 Can you be held liable for framing copyrighted content?
by Siddhant Sharma

In the context of a webpage, a "Frame" is a bordered area within that webpage acting as an independent browser window in itself showing the content of a secondary target webpage or website. Framing allows the viewer screen to split into multiple independent scrollable sections (just like the 'picture-in-picture' feature).

    The issue with framing is that an end user will be viewing a copyrighted content of a website, framed by an alternate site - with an alternate URL, diverse logos and promotions - thereby, creating a likelihood of confusion in the mind of the end user. Furthermore, the "framer" might also not have taken authorization from the author/owner of the framed content before framing it.

During the nascent years of the Internet, this practice used to constitute copyright infringement in a few jurisdictions, in light of the fact that a duplicate of the material is made in the client's computer memory. In an age old case of Roche Lexicon (2001), a Hamburg court decided that "the RAM copies created in the process of framing constituted a reproduction of the work that must be authorized by the rights holder."

However, the aforesaid proposition of law is no more followed and framing a content is considered to be fair use unless the framed content itself constitute infringed material. Recent rulings of the EU court substantiate this fact.

In the BestWater case (C-348/13) the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled that embedding copyrighted videos is not a violation of copyright, even when the source video is uploaded without the permission from the right holder. The Court observed:

    “The embedding in a website of a protected work which is publicly accessible on another website by means of a link using the framing technology … does not by itself constitute communication to the public within the meaning of [the EU Copyright directive] to the extent that the relevant work is neither communicated to a new public nor by using a specific technical means different from that used for the original communication...”

The BestWater case was predominantly based on the ratio of a landmark case of Svensson v Retriever Sverige wherein the Court had held that there is no copyright infringement in case of linking or framing a copyrighted content, if the content has not been altered, since the content was already made available to the public. CJEU further observed that even if such linking and framing is done without authorization, then also, it does not amount to copyright infringement.

Thus the rationale behind these judgment comes out to be as follows

    "Right of communication to the public - if a work has been made available online, linking to it does not expose it to new audiences, so the right remains intact and linking is not an infringement."

However, the European Copyright Society opinions otherwise.
My Opinion

Although these EU rulings do clear the air from the issue of copyright infringement in case of linking and framing, thereby, also concluding that incorporating frames on your website is totally legit.

    However, these rulings are still ambiguous with regard to the following two issues:

    What if the framed section, containing copyrightable material of someone else, causes confusion in the mind of the end user as to the actual source of the information?

    What if the framed content significantly alters the information and the way it is displayed, in such a way that the end user might get the impression that the owner of the framed information endorses or voluntarily choses to be associated with the framer?

It is clear that law has continued to respond, through legislative and judicial developments, to the questions raised by the emerging practices of connecting information and users to materials online. Owing to the borderless nature of the world wide web, it is imperative that such legislative and judicial responses are compatible so as to enable users and website owners to legitimately exploit the cyberspace with confidence.
